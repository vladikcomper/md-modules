# Compiling MD-Shell

MD-Shell uses CBundle utility to produce bundles that target different assemblers. This process simply combines various code fragments found in this directory (and generated by MD-Shell's build script) into a single file, where CBundle acts similarly to a pre-processor.

Currently, the following assemblers are supported:

* __ASM68K__ (`bundle-asm68k`)
* __The AS Macroassembler__ v.1.42 Bld 55 and above (`bundle-as`)

> **Warning**
>
> The AS Macroassembler version has limited support for some features!

## Building MDShell bundles

```sh
cd modules/mdshell/
make
```

Bundles will be generated in `build/modules/mdshell`.

## Testing

Additionally, you may generate test ROMs:

```sh
cd modules/mdshell/
make tests
```

ROMs will be generated in `build/modules/mdshell/tests`.
