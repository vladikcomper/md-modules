# MD-Shell bundles

MD-Shell uses CBundle utility to produce bundles that target different assemblers. This process simply combines various code fragments found in this directory (and generated by MD-Shell's build script) into a single file, where CBundle acts similarly to a pre-processor.

Currently, the following assemblers are supported:

* __ASM68K__ (`bundle-asm68k`)
* __The AS Macroassembler__ v.1.42 Bld 55 and above (`bundle-as`)

> **Warning**
>
> The AS Macroassembler version has limited support for some features!

## Building bundles

Building is simple: Make sure to build MD-Shell, then run `build-bundles.sh` or `build-bundles.bat` script from this directory.

### Linux

```sh
cd modules/mdshell
./build.sh
cd bundles
./build-bundles.sh
```

### Windows

Build MD-Shell by running `build.bat` from the parent directory, then run `build-bundles.bat`.
