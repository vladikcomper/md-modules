Please refer to this link for presentation and detailed description: https://sonicresearch.org/community/index.php?threads/advanced-error-handler-and-debugger.4442/#post-78456

## Supported assemblers

Currently, the *Advanced Error Handler and Debugger 2.0* supports integration with the following assemblers:

* __ASM68K__ (`bundle-asm68k`)
* __The AS Macroassembler__ v.1.42 Bld 55 and above (bundle-as)

> **Warning**
>
> The AS Macroassembler version has limited support for some features!

# Working with Error Handler bundles

To keep maintaining different versions of bundles easier, they are mostly built from the "shared" pieces of code using `cbundle` utility (source code is available in the same repository).
